Overview
This project is a basic bartending simulator creating with p5.js using the Matter.js physics engine. At the moment you just make simple drinks and try to fight the very chaotic physics. This is the first time I've ever used a physics library so it was extremely intimidating. Although I couldn't figure out how to implement many of the features I hoped, I'm still very happy with how it turned out. The main feature I couldn't figure out how to implement was the ability to open and close the cocktail without it falling apart or glitching out. I wanted the player to have the ability to put things in the shaker then shake pour it into the glass but it was so difficult I had to simplify it.

Controls
To play the game use the mouse to grab objects and the scroll wheel to rotate them. You can pickup cherries, ice and oranges
from the buckets at the bottom and put them in the glass. You can also pour whiskey out of the bottle.
